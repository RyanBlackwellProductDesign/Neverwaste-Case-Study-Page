    <p>Team Members: Ryan Blackwell, Michael Long, Kira Gallagher, and Rayna Jeremias 
        Tools Used: Figma, Miro, Sketch, Keynote, Google docs, Adobe Illustrator, Sketchbook 
        Duration: Four Weeks</p>

      <p>The Problem: American households waste $133 billion pounds of food every year, which totals $161 billion. 
        The Solution: Our team set out to design a solution to help the modern American household monitor and manage their food consumption and disposal habits.</p>

    <div class="Text">
      <p>Research: We created a research plan that included a Google Survey and 1x1 interviews. We wanted to understand household demographics and how income plays a role in purchase and waste habits. 
        We found that 67% of survey respondents said income plays a role in their purchase habits, and that 71% waste up to 5 lbs of food per week. Other products that try to help people waste less food are apps and the Samsung smart fridge, which helps people manage their food inventory. One app that aims to help people eliminate food waste is Foodfully. 
        Primary research data revealed that a majority of families want to reduce their carbon footprint, but lack the tools necessary to monitor and easily manage household  food inventories.</p>

<img src="05 Empathy Map.png" width='100%'>
    <div class="Text">
      <p>Empathy Map: Jordan feels guilty that he and his family waste food on a weekly basis. He is looking to develop healthy, sustainable eating habits  to help his family save more money and waste less food.</p>
</div>
<img src="06 User Persona.png" width='100%'>
    <div class="Text">
      <p>User Persona: Our user, Jordan, is a married college professor with two children. He’s passionate about sustainability, organic cooking, and reducing food waste. Jordan’s income limits the amount of food he can purchase, so making every penny count and not wasting needlessly are important.</p>
</div>
<img src="07 Competitor Analysis.png" width='100%'>
    <div class="Text">
      <p>Competitor Analysis: We created a competitor analysis to look at products already on the market and how our idea brought something new to the table.</p>
</div>
<img src="08 User Flow.png" width='100%'>
    <div class="Text">
      <p>User Flow: We wanted to make it easy for our users to inventory and manage their household food items. To do this, we mapped out the respective paths a user may take while onboarding, uploading inventory, interacting with a food item, and finding a suggested recipe.</p>
</div>
<img src="09 Lo fi wireframes.png" width='100%'>
    <div class="Text">
      <p>Sketches & Wireframes: Our initial sketches provided a framework for where we wanted key features and an overall concept of how we wanted our app to look. </p>
</div>
<img src="10 IOS prototype Screen.png" width='100%'>
    <div class="Text">
      <p>Prototype: While not a complete working prototype, our group did design some high resolution prototype screens to give  an idea of what the final product would look like.</p>
</div>
<img src="11 Next Steps.png" width='100%'>
    <div class="Text">
      <p>Moving Forward: Our group’s timeframe for this project was four short weeks. While we achived a lot, we also had ideas for how Neverwaste could be further built upon. Each group member had input on what they would like to see implemented had time permitted or if we were to move forward with our application.</p>
